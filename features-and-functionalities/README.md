üéØ Objective
This document identifies and details the core features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend. It serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the technical and functional requirements needed to build a scalable, secure, and robust system.

üîë Core Functionalities
The backend must support the essential features that power a rental marketplace.

1. User Management
User Registration: Allows users to sign up as either guests or hosts.

Authentication: Implements secure user login with email/password and supports OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook). Secure user sessions are managed using JWT.

Profile Management: Enables users to update their personal information, contact details, and profile photos.

2. Property Listings Management
CRUD Operations: Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings.

Listing Details: Each listing includes key information such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.

3. Search and Filtering
Search Functionality: Users can find properties based on location, price range, number of guests, and amenities.

Pagination: The system includes pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.

4. Booking Management
Booking Creation: Guests can book a property for specific dates. The system prevents double bookings through date validation.

Cancellation: Allows both guests and hosts to cancel bookings.

Booking Status: Tracks booking statuses, including pending, confirmed, canceled, and completed.

5. Payment Integration
Secure Payments: Integrates secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions.

Transaction Types: Manages upfront payments from guests and automatic payouts to hosts.

Multi-Currency Support: Handles transactions in multiple currencies.

6. Reviews and Ratings
User Reviews: Guests can submit reviews and ratings for properties after a stay.

Host Responses: Hosts can respond to reviews.

Integrity: Reviews are tied to specific bookings to ensure authenticity.

7. Notifications System
Alerts: Implements email and in-app notifications for critical updates like booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment statuses.

8. Admin Dashboard
Administration: Provides an interface for admins to monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
These are the foundational technical components needed to build the backend.

1. Database Management
Database: Uses a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Schema: Requires tables for Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.

2. API Development
API Type: Employs RESTful APIs with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Alternative: GraphQL is a recommended option for complex data fetching.

3. Authentication and Authorization
Session Management: Uses JWT for secure user sessions.

Access Control: Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.

4. File Storage
Cloud Storage: Stores property images and user profile photos on a scalable cloud service like AWS S3 or Cloudinary.

5. Third-Party Services
Email Service: Integrates with services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

6. Error Handling
Logging: Implements robust global error handling and logging for all API endpoints.

üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements
These requirements ensure the system is performant, scalable, and secure.

1. Scalability
Architecture: Uses a modular architecture to facilitate easy scaling.

Load Balancing: Supports horizontal scaling with load balancers to handle high traffic.

2. Security
Data Protection: Encrypts sensitive data like passwords and payment information.

Threat Prevention: Uses firewalls and rate limiting to protect against malicious activities.

3. Performance Optimization
Caching: Utilizes caching tools like Redis to speed up data retrieval.

Query Optimization: Optimizes database queries to reduce server load and improve response times.

4. Testing
Automated Tests: Implements unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest to ensure functionality and reliability.
