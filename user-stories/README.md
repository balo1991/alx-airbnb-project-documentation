# User Stories – Airbnb Clone

## 📖 Overview
This directory contains the **user stories** derived from the Use Case Diagram of the Airbnb Clone project.  
Each story captures an interaction between a system actor (Guest, Host, or Admin) and the backend system.  

To make these stories **testable and developer-friendly**, we have included **acceptance criteria in BDD format (Given/When/Then)**.
